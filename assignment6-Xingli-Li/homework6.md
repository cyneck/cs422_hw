### 1.1-2-(a)

**Answer:**

s({e}) = $\frac{8}{10}$  

s({b, d}) = $\frac{2}{10}$

s({b, d, e}) = $\frac{2}{10}$

### 1.1-2-(b)

**Answer:**

c(bd −> e) = $\frac{2}{10}$ ${\div}$  $\frac{2}{10}$ =100%

c(e −> bd) = $\frac{2}{10}$ ${\div}$  $\frac{8}{10}$ =25%

No, confidence is not a symmetric measure.

### 1.1-2-(c)

**Answer:**

s({e}) =  $\frac{4}{5}$

s({b, d}) = $\frac{5}{5}$

s({b, d, e}) = $\frac{4}{5}$

### 1.1-2-(d)

**Answer:**

c(bd −> e) = $\frac{4}{5} \div \frac{5}{5}$  = 80%

c(e -> bd) = $\frac{4}{5} \div \frac{4}{5}$ = 100%

### 1.1-2-(e)

**Answer:**

There are no obvious  relationships.
